In this project we tried to predict the direction of the price of a Google share in the stock market thanks to recurrent neural networks.
We have five years of historical data for the Google share price between 2012 and 2016.
So our objective will be to use this data from these five years of history, we will try to predict simply the first month of January 2017. 
So we're going to try to predict the trend of what the share will go up or what it will rather go down.

For our data we have 2 files :

#"Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv"# : it is a file that contain our Training Set to train our Model.
#"Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv"# : it is a file that contain our Test Set for January of 2017 to Test our Model.

To train our Model we slited it to 4 steps :

# Part 1 - Data Preprocessing 
# Part 2 - Building the RNN
# Part 3 - Making the predictions and visualising the results
# Part 4 Performance Evaluation
